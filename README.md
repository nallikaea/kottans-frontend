## Git Basics

- Сourse **Version Control with Git** - FINISHED.
 This is a very good course for beginners. The material is presented in an accessible and high quality. He helped me quickly understand the version-control system GIT and use the basic commands such as for example:
 
  - git init and git clone - for start the project;
  - git log and git status;
  - git add and git commit - to make commits;
  - git diff - to see detailed differens;
  - .gitignore - for ignore files by GIT;
  - git branch, git checkout and git merge - for working with branches;
  - git revert, git reset - for edit/delete commits;
  - etc.
  
- **Introduction Sequence, Push & Pull** (learngitbranching.js.org) - COMPLITED.
 This resource gave me additional knowledge about working with branches and also taught me how to work with remote repositories. Commands, I learned here:
  - git rebase - type of merging;
  - git fetch - download;
  - git pull - git fetch + git merge;
  - git push - share my work;
  - and ohter;
