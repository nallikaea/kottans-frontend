## Git Basics
:smile:
- Сourse **Version Control with Git** - FINISHED.:star:
 This is a very good course for beginners. The material is presented in an accessible and high quality. He helped me quickly understand the version-control system GIT and use the basic commands such as for example:

  - git init and git clone - for start the project;
  - git log and git status;
  - git add and git commit - to make commits;
  - git diff - to see detailed differens;
  - .gitignore - for ignore files by GIT;
  - git branch, git checkout and git merge - for working with branches;
  - git revert, git reset - for edit/delete commits;
  - etc.

- **Introduction Sequence, Push & Pull** (learngitbranching.js.org) - COMPLITED.:star:
 This resource gave me additional knowledge about working with branches and also taught me how to work with remote repositories. Commands, I learned here:
  - git rebase - type of merging;
  - git fetch - download;
  - git pull - git fetch + git merge;
  - git push - share my work;
  - and other;

- Repository "kottans-frontend" and README.md file with my impressions about learned materials created.:feet:

- Pull-request to Kottans/mock-repo with my greeting and cat sended.:love_letter:

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
:smile:
- Сourse **Linux Survival (4 modules)** - FINISHED.:star:
 This course taught me how to use CLI. I had an experience with command line it the past, but repetition was very useful for me. I want to write some commands here:
  - ls - list of content in directory;
  - more - properties;
  - mkdir <name> - make directory;
  - mv <from> <to> - move, rename;
  - cd <where> (cd ..) - chenge directory (up one directory);
  - pwd - print working directory;
  - cp <name> <name> - copy;
  - rm <name>, rmdir <name> - remove file and directoty. To remove directory tree -r need to be added;
  - security atributes: r(read), w(write), x(execute); Users can be owner, group or other;
  - chmod (example: chmod ugo-rwx) - change security mode;
  - man is for manual;
  - find ~ -name "name*"
  - cat file1 file2 > file;
  - lpr, lpq, lprm -commands for printer;
  - df - free disk space;
  - ps aux - show active procesess;
  - grep <text> - find some text in file;
  - kill, kill -9 <idp> - kill some process by ID;

 - Article **HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know** - READED.:star:

  This is very fullness article about how HTTP works. It tells about URL, status codes and request/response headers, connection handling, identification, authentication and caching. I learned something about it during my study at the university, and this article helped me to remember and learn many new information, for example about security.

  Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the stateless, application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems, and is the foundation of the modern web. :muscle::muscle::muscle:

 Request verbs, which is I definitely will use:
  - GET: fetch an existing resource.
  - POST: create a new resource.
  - PUT: update an existing resource.
  - DELETE: delete an existing resource.
  - OPTIONS: used to retrieve the server capabilities.


## Intro to HTML & CSS

  :smile:
  - Сourse **Intro to HTML & CSS (Eng)** - FINISHED.:star:
  This was simple intro course for beginners with good visualizations about main concepts of HTML and CSS.

  - Сourse **Learn HTML(Eng)** (Codeacademy) - FINISHED.:star:

  This is a more compleх HTML-course that covers many rules for writing code elements. By taking this course, you can write a good informational website.

  - Сourse **Learn CSS(Eng)** (Codeacademy) - FINISHED.:star:

  This Cascading Style Sheet course is very good and long. He tells not only how to add colors and fonts to your HTML-code, but also how to build a real functional layout and how to add interactive elements to website using only CSS, without any Javascript code. Amazing.
  
  These three courses provide a good foundation to write your first high-level interactive website. I will definitely use it all.
